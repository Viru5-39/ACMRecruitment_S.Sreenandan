The original code for finding the second largest number had two problems. 
First, it set both largest and second to -9999999. This works for many cases, but it fails when the input numbers are smaller since the algorithm won’t update correctly. 
Second, the condition elif num > second did not check if num was equal to the current largest. 
This meant that if the largest number appeared more than once, the code could wrongly identify it as the second largest.

The revised version uses float('-inf') to represent “smaller than anything,” making sure that any real number will replace it. 
It also adds a num != largest check to prevent duplicates of the maximum from replacing the second largest. 
Finally, it returns None when there aren’t enough unique elements to determine a second largest number.
